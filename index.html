    <h1>Hi. I'm Mathusan Kandiah</h1>


    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        My name is Mathusan Kandiah and I'm a trainee Full Stck Developer at Futureproof. 
        My desire for coding started when I watched a youtube video on how machine learning was being sued to detect guns and other dangerous items in airports. I thought it was so fascinating how something so fundamental as coding could produce such a complex, almost <strong>human</strong>, program.
        Since then, I've strived to further my knowledge both through theory i.e. reading and watching tutorials vidoes on how to program complex programs for coour detection using openCV, but also simpler programs, like an animation of a boucning ball.
